# Demo 
This exercise is a demostration of the CSS Box Model to my students. 

The parent div element is given a class selector of container. 
The child div element is given a class selector of article.
Padding increases the space between the edge of a box and the content inside of it.
Margin increases the space between a box and any others that sit next to it.
Border adds space (even if itâ€™s only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding.
